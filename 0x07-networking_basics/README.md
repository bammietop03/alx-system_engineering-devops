## LEARNING NETWORKING BASICS

## OSI model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into seven distinct layers. These layers help in understanding and organizing the various processes and protocols involved in network communication. The seven layers of the OSI model, from bottom to top, are:

1. Physical Layer: Deals with the physical transmission of data, such as cables, switches, and electrical signals.

2. Data Link Layer: Responsible for framing data into packets, addressing, and error detection and correction at the link level.

3. Network Layer: Manages routing and addressing to enable data to travel between different networks or subnets.

4. Transport Layer: Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and data flow control between devices.

5. Session Layer: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions or connections between applications.

6. Presentation Layer: Translates, encrypts, or compresses data for transmission, making sure it's in a format that can be understood by the application layer.

7. Application Layer: Provides a user interface for accessing network services and applications, such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.

## Different types of network

**LAN (Local Area Network):**

	Think of a LAN like your home or a small office network.
	It's a small, private network that connects devices like computers, printers, and smartphones within a limited area, like a single building or your home.
	It's like the local community of devices that can talk to each other, share files, and printers, but they don't extend too far beyond your home or office.

**WAN (Wide Area Network):**

	A WAN is like a vast network that covers a much larger area, like a city, country, or even the whole world.
	It connects multiple LANs and other networks over long distances, often using the internet as the backbone.
	Imagine it as the highways that connect different cities; it helps devices in one city (LAN) communicate with devices in other cities.
**WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):**

	A WLAN is like a wireless version of a LAN.
	Instead of using cables to connect devices, it uses Wi-Fi signals.
	So, it's like having a local network in your home or office, but you can connect to it wirelessly with your laptop, smartphone, or tablet without plugging in any cables.

## How the internet works 

1. Devices and Data: The internet is a massive network of interconnected devices like computers, servers, and smartphones. These devices send and receive data in the form of text, images, videos, and more.

2. Data Packets: When you send information over the internet, it's broken down into small packets of data. Each packet contains a piece of your message, along with the destination address.

3. Routers: Data packets travel through a web of routers, which are like the traffic cops of the internet. Routers examine the destination address on each packet and decide where to send it next.

4. Internet Service Providers (ISPs): Your data may pass through various ISPs, which are companies that provide internet access. ISPs act as gateways to the global internet network.

5. Backbone Networks: There are high-speed data highways known as backbone networks, which carry massive amounts of data across long distances. These networks connect continents and countries.

6. Protocols: The internet relies on a set of rules and protocols (like TCP/IP) to ensure that data is transmitted correctly and reliably. These protocols help devices communicate effectively.

7. Servers: When you visit a website or use an app, you're typically connecting to a server. Servers store and provide the content or services you're accessing.

8. Domain Name System (DNS): The DNS system translates human-readable website addresses (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers understand. This allows your device to find the right server.

9. Encryption: To keep data secure during transmission, many websites and services use encryption (e.g., HTTPS). This means that data is scrambled and can only be unscrambled by the intended recipient.

10. User Devices: Your computer, smartphone, or other devices act as clients. They send requests for data (e.g., loading a web page) and receive the data in response.

11. Two-Way Communication: The internet is bidirectional, meaning that data flows back and forth. When you click a link, the request goes out, and the response (the web page) comes back to your device.

12. Global Network: The internet is a global network because it connects devices all around the world. It doesn't matter where you are; you can access data and services from anywhere with internet access.

## What is MAC Address

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a string of characters that identifies a device on a network. Itâ€™s tied to a key connection device in your computer called the network interface card, or NIC. The NIC is essentially a computer circuit card that makes it possible for your computer to connect to a network. A NIC turns data into an electrical signal that can be transmitted over the network.

## What is an IP Address

Every machine on the the Internet has a unique number assigned to it, called an IP address. Without a unique IP address on your machine, you will not be able to communicate with other devices, users, and computers on the Internet. You can look at your IP address as if it were a telephone number, each one being unique and used to identify a way to reach you and only you.
